# Performance — principles, priorities, gotchas

Three perf passes have already shipped (see CHANGELOG "Performance (pass 1/2/3)"
and the audit docs at `.claude/perf-audit-plan.md` + `.claude/perf-pass-2-plan.md`).
The *what* of each fix lives there. This file is the *how to think about it
next time* — the priority ordering, the mental model, and the gotchas worth
internalizing before touching graphics code.

The canonical source for the priority list is the r/threejs
"how to optimize for low-end computers" thread:
<https://www.reddit.com/r/threejs/comments/skk0f3/how_to_optimize_project_for_lowend_computers/>.
The shipped passes followed it almost directly.

## 2026-10-08 audit: current work order

The source audit and Mac GPU probes are preserved in
[`verification/performance/2026-10-08/astra-results.json`](../../verification/performance/2026-10-08/astra-results.json)
and [`astra-probes.json`](../../verification/performance/2026-10-08/astra-probes.json).
They were recorded on an M4 Pro in Chrome 152 at seed `3948869160`, before the
fixes below. They establish costs and defects on that machine, not expected FPS
gains on every device. The desktop and phone guided captures in
[`DEBUGGING.md`](../../DEBUGGING.md#desktop-and-phone-performance-playtests)
remain the device acceptance check.

| Priority | Finding and evidence | Acceptance condition |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | The renderer changes pixel ratio, but `EffectComposer` retains its own ratio. The audit measured a 1200×863 canvas with a 2400×1726 scene target and 7.44–7.79 ms GPU time at the oversized target versus 4.28–5.53 ms when correctly sized. See `src/adaptiveQuality.js` `_apply` / `setPixelRatio`, `src/main.js` `handleResize`, and `astra-results.json` `sizing`. | One size owner keeps renderer, composer, FXAA, and bloom aligned through quality changes and viewport resize. Check actual targets, not just CSS dimensions. |
| 2 | The fancy transmissive bubble mesh remains visible with no live instances. The audit measured 4,245 scene draws visible versus 2,160 hidden, with a lower CPU render-call time when hidden. See `src/bubbles.js` constructor / `update` and `astra-results.json` `emptyBubbles`. | Hide only after the last live or popping bubble dies; restore visibility on emission and preserve trails through material switches. |
| 3 | `isPointInLake` iterates all registry entries despite a lake-only index. Seven lakes among 3,983 entries produced 201–211 ms versus 2.6–2.7 ms for 10,000 identical queries, with zero result differences. See `src/lakes.js` lake helpers, `src/registry.js` `byKind`, and `astra-probes.json` `lakeProbe`. | Preserve insertion order, exact polygon and legacy-outline behavior, plus add/remove lifecycle. |
| 4 | Turning shadows off clears existing caster flags, but 287 newly streamed meshes had `castShadow` true while the setting still read off. See `src/adaptiveQuality.js` `_setShadowsOn` and `astra-probes.json` `shadowProbe`. This proves policy drift, not a GPU-memory leak or 287 shadow draws. | The off state survives travel and unload, casts no shadows at dawn or night, and restores correctly without retaining detached meshes. |
| 5 | A 3/4/5 ms admission budget does not bound synchronous chunk construction; the audit saw 196–220 ms individual chunks. See `src/world.js` `update`, `src/chunks.js` `_generate`, and `ROADMAP.md` performance Slice 3. | Use one streaming deadline, then split a measured hot builder while preserving synchronous collider truth, `isLoaded`, and deterministic registries. |
| 6 | Road-neighbor enumeration and overlapping far-field planning repeat work, but their projected savings overlap. See `src/worldgen/roads.js`, `src/farField.js`, and the audit report. | Memoize road neighbors first with bounded retention and seed/tuning invalidation, then remeasure horizon work before caching its records. |
| 7 | Hidden-tab timers and overdue audio schedulers can amplify a scheduling gap. See `src/main.js` `scheduleNext`, `src/adaptiveQuality.js` `tick`, and `src/sound.js` schedulers. This is resilience work, not an established cause of the historical freeze. | Keep hidden-tab ticking only for explicit automation, reset quality timing on resume, and bound missed-beat emission without changing musical progression. |

Items 1–4 and 6 now have code fixes and targeted tests. Item 5 now shares one
admission deadline across lakes, chunks, and the far-field planner, but a
single synchronous chunk can still overrun that deadline. The live low-tier game
confirmed aligned canvas and scene targets at two quality levels; the live
high-tier game confirmed the sun's shadow state follows On → Off → On without
console errors. Device-level gains and the travel/unload shadow acceptance check
remain pending. The chunk-builder split and item 7 remain open because the audit
did not isolate a safe builder split or establish a hidden-tab/audio cause for
the freeze.

The audit also proved that a module worker can import the existing pure
worldgen code and produce byte-identical region data without a bundler
(`astra-probes.json` `workerProbe`). That removes the blanket tooling blocker in
`ROADMAP.md`, but it does not establish that worker transfer and asynchronous
commit are a net win. Broad model merging already failed its real-GPU gate,
and the current draw/triangle HUD budgets need recalibration before their
colors can serve as a verdict (`ROADMAP.md` Performance).

### 2026-10-08 review of commit `c86f5de`: capture reliability gate

Astra's follow-up review is preserved in
[`review-summary.md`](../../.codex/reviews/001-c86f5de-perf-fixes/review-summary.md).
The core render-size, empty-bubble, lake-index, road-cache, and shadow-policy
fixes passed its checks. The review reproduced these seven follow-ups. The
capture and chunk fixes are now implemented and covered by focused regression
cases, while real-device playtests remain the final evidence gate:

| Priority | Follow-up | Review evidence |
|---|---|---|
| P1 | Serialize periodic, manual, and final uploads; announce completion only after the final report is saved. | Finding 1; `src/debug.js:2201-2225` |
| P2 | Flush the outgoing frame window before changing its phase or Trip state. | Finding 2; `src/debug.js:2078-2089` |
| P2 | Distinguish initial chunk preload from empty residency after an unload, so an expired deadline cannot admit the whole ring. | Finding 3; `src/chunks.js:349,370-395` |
| P2 | Align guided phase labels with actual Trip state, including slow frames and tab visibility changes. | Finding 4; `src/debug.js:2041-2054,2074-2089` |
| P2 | Keep free-form `?perfCapture=1` recording across tab resume. | Finding 5; `src/debug.js:2051-2054` |
| P2 | Freeze the completed report once and resend that identical snapshot on retry. | Finding 6; `src/debug.js:2144-2168,2194-2196` |
| P3 | Check quality, DPR, and physical render dimensions across all comparison phases, excluding settling. | Finding 7; `bin/report-perf-playtest:85-88` |

`bin/test-device-capture-flow` covers phase-window ownership, slow Trip
fade-in, free-form tab resume, serial upload ordering, final acknowledgement,
and identical failed-upload retries. `bin/test-chunk-deadline` covers the
expired-deadline empty-residency path, and `bin/test-perf-report` covers
quality changes across phase boundaries. The project check and main-game
smoke test passed on low and high tiers. Gary completed desktop Chrome and
real-iPhone Safari drive and Trip captures on 2026-10-09; the bounded findings
and next experiment are in
[`guided-playtests.md`](../../verification/performance/2026-10-09/guided-playtests.md).
A fresh GPU benchmark is still needed to measure the visual changes.

## Audit order (highest-impact first)

When approaching a perf task, audit in this order. Earlier phases unlock
clarity on later ones.

| # | Audit | Why first |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **`renderer.info` overlay** (already in backtick HUD) | You can't tune what you can't see. Open the panel; read draws / tris / geometries / textures / heap. **Always start here.** |
| 2 | **Shadow casters** | `castShadow = true` redraws every caster every frame from the sun's POV — by far the highest per-frame multiplier. Pass 1 dropped 115 → 56 and saved ~60 draws/frame. |
| 3 | **Dispose-safety on pooled resources** | Long-session stability. A mis-disposed shared material storms shader recompiles. Tag `userData.shared = true`; the chunk/lake unloaders skip those. |
| 4 | **Post-process pass gating** | Each pass is a full-screen render+sample. The Trip pass had to learn `pass.enabled = false` when envelope == 0. Apply the same pattern to any new pass. |
| 5 | **InstancedMesh + variant buckets** | One draw call replaces N. Sugar Shack string bulbs (20 → 1), drum-circle benches (~45 → 2). Use it when the same geometry repeats per chunk/per cluster. |
| 6 | **Material + geometry pooling** | Allocation-time win, not steady-state. Matters during chunk spawns; not during quiet driving. See `.claude/rules/perf-pooling.md`. |
| 7 | **Pixel ratio + AA strategy** | MSAA at ratio 2 is brutal on integrated GPUs. Mid/low get `antialias: false` + FXAAPass instead. |
| 8 | **Texture sizes** | One-time memory cost, **not** an FPS issue unless you're memory-bound. Cap at 1024 (iOS > 2048 crash risk). Don't sweat 2048 unless symptoms point at memory. |

If a phase doesn't move the needle on the HUD numbers, **stop optimizing
there and move to the next.** Don't pre-optimize categories the budget panel
says are fine.

## Allocation cost ≠ steady-state cost

These are different bugs with different symptoms — diagnose accordingly.

- **Allocation cost** shows as **frame stalls** when something spawns (a new
  chunk crosses the load ring, a campsite materializes, the first Sugar Shack
  appears). Fixed by pooling, budgeting (1 chunk/frame), and disposal
  safety.
- **Steady-state cost** shows as **low baseline FPS** even while parked.
  Fixed by shadow audit, post-process gating, instancing, AA strategy.

Pooling does almost nothing for steady-state FPS; the shack already built.
Shadow audits do almost nothing for the spawn-stall on boost into new
territory. Match the fix to the symptom.

## Heuristics + rules of thumb

### "Tighter frustum > smaller shadow map"

When reducing shadow cost on lower tiers, don't *just* drop the map
resolution (1024 → 512). Also tighten the sun's orthographic frustum
(`shadowD` from 100 → 60). A smaller map covering a smaller area is *sharper
per texel* than a smaller map covering the same area. The mid-tier shadow
config does both deliberately.

### "Small detail meshes don't appear distinct in shadow anyway"

Tent poles, sign brackets, lamppost shafts, NPC limbs, raffia strands, chair
parts, firepit stones, mustache hairs — they all *could* cast shadows but
players can't tell them apart from the larger object's shadow. **Don't cast
shadows from small detail.** Cast only from: tent roofs, main walls, large
body capsules, banners facing the player, tree crowns, chassis main bits,
wheels. The 56 remaining casters are roughly that list.

### "Avoid transparent. Prefer alphaTest. Opaque > both."

Transparent objects force three.js to sort every frame and expand the
depth-test work. If the texture is essentially binary-masked (a tiki flame, a
leaf cutout, signage with text on alpha) use `alphaTest: 0.5` on a regular
Lambert/Standard instead. You lose smooth edges; you gain a lot of perf.
Reserve true transparency for genuinely translucent things (bubbles, glass,
volumetric).

### "Emissive doesn't cast shadows."

Self-illuminating materials (campfires, tiki flames, stage lights,
bulb-emissive shaders) are additive-final. They contribute light *visually*
but they aren't `Light` objects — no shadow caster, no `castShadow` knob
worth flipping. If you want shadows *from* a fire, add a `PointLight` (gated
by `PERF.contextLights`, `castShadow = false` for cheapness).

### "One light per cluster, not one per element."

Campsites have one PointLight at the firepit, not one per torch. Sugar
Shacks have three lights total (two work spotlights + one interior), not one
per string-light bulb. Drum circles have one fire light, not one per
torchlit dancer. Lights are expensive; clusters look fine with a single
proxy.

### "Cap pixel ratio. Don't trust devicePixelRatio."

`renderer.setPixelRatio(Math.min(window.devicePixelRatio, PERF.pixelRatioCap))`.
Retina iPhones report 3.0; rendering at 3× over a 1170-pixel-wide screen is
~10M pixels per frame at the canvas alone. Cap at 1.0 / 1.5 / 2.0
(low/mid/high). Adaptive quality can drop further at runtime.

## Footguns / no-nos

### Don't `THREE.X = Y` after import

ES module namespaces are frozen. Safari mobile (and any spec-strict runtime)
throws "Cannot assign to property of [object Module]" on
post-import reassignment. The whole boot dies. If you need a tier-aware
override of a three.js export, do it via the `'three'` importmap entry
pointing at `src/threeShim.js`, the same way the MeshStandardMaterial swap
works. See the comment block at the top of `threeShim.js`.

### Don't dispose without the `userData.shared` check

```js
// Safe disposal walk in chunk/lake unload
obj.traverse((n) => {
  if (n.geometry && !n.geometry.userData.shared) n.geometry.dispose();
  if (n.material && !n.material.userData.shared) n.material.dispose();
});
```

A mis-disposed shared material **doesn't crash** — it silently triggers a
shader recompile the next frame any other chunk uses that material. Recompile
storms (50+ in a frame) show up as periodic ~200ms stalls that look like GC
pauses. They're not GC.

### Don't reflexively `castShadow = true` on new meshes

It's `false` by default for a reason. Adding a new model? Default everything
to off. Turn on only the meshes whose shadow shape would actually read
distinctly on the ground. The audit drove the count from 115 → 56; don't
walk it back.

### Don't add transparency to InstancedMesh without considering sort cost

Sorting transparent instances per-frame is much worse than sorting
non-instanced transparent meshes (the GPU can't depth-sort within a single
draw call). If you need translucency on instances, see if `alphaTest` works
first.

### Don't try to optimize before you've measured

Open the backtick debug panel. **Read the budget markers.** If draws/tris
are green (`ok`), the next perf pass is wasted work. The HUD shows per-tier
budgets (low 80/150k, mid 200/400k, high 400/1.2M) precisely so you don't
need to guess.

### Don't ship a perf change without checking `?perf=low` and `?perf=mid`

High tier hides regressions that crush integrated GPUs. The threeShim
Lambert swap, the FXAA-not-MSAA branch, and the chunk-load budget all exist
because something looked fine on high and was broken on low/mid. Verify the
quiet tiers.

## When perf work stops being worth it

Diminishing returns hit fast in three.js. If the budget panel is green at
the tier you care about, **declare done.** Don't chase another 5% if it adds
complexity to a system that has to stay readable. The "boil the ocean" rule
applies to *correctness* — not to perf. Perf is bounded by what the player
can perceive on the target device.

## Open items deferred to ROADMAP

The perf passes deferred a few things explicitly (see ROADMAP "Performance"
section): LOD on distant trees/tents, geometry merging at chunk completion,
texture mipmap audit, light-layers for the Sugar Shack work spots,
variant-bucketed InstancedMesh for tiki torches + chairs. These were
considered and parked, not missed. Don't re-propose them as "obvious next
wins" without checking ROADMAP first — Gary has thought about each.

The won't-do list: three-mesh-bvh (no raycast bottleneck here) and lookAt
caching (no hot path). Don't suggest these.
